VLC Auto Update Script
===========
This script silently downloads the latest VLC binaries for Mac OS X 
and copies them to the Application directory, overwriting any files that
may share the same name. It relies on a rather specific regex
and that the latest VLC installer is available through the
remote directory listed in the script. Last known to work 4/17/1 for VLC
2.1.4, OS X versions 10.8 and 10.9.
